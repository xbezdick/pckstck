# Kickstart file for composing the "Fedora Cloud" spin of Fedora (rawhide)
# Maintained by the Fedora Release Engineering team:
# https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/ReleaseEngineering
# mailto:rel-eng@lists.fedoraproject.org

# Use a part of 'iso' to define how large you want your isos.
# Only used when composing to more than one iso.
# Default is 695 (megs), CD size.
# Listed below is the size of a DVD if you wanted to split higher.
#part iso --size=4998

# Add the repos you wish to use to compose here.  At least one of them needs group data.

# Only uncomment repo commands in one of the two following sections.
# Because the install kickstart doesn't use the updates repo and does 
# use the source repo, we can't just include fedora-repo.ks

# In the master branch the rawhide repo commands should be uncommented.
#repo --name=rawhide --mirrorlist=http://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/mirrorlist?repo=rawhide&arch=$basearch
#repo --name=rawhide-source  --mirrorlist=http://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/mirrorlist?repo=rawhide-source&arch=$basearch

# In non-master branches the fedora repo commands should be uncommented
#repo --name=fedora --mirrorlist=http://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/mirrorlist?repo=fedora-$releasever&arch=$basearch
#repo --name=fedora-source  --mirrorlist=http://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/mirrorlist?repo=fedora-source-$releasever&arch=$basearch

# Package manifest for the compose.  Uses repo group metadata to translate groups.
# (default groups for the configured repos are added by --default)
# @base got renamed to @standard, but @base is still included by default by pungi.
%packages --default

# pungi is an inclusive depsolver so that multiple packages are brought 
# in to satisify dependencies and we don't always want that. So we  use
# an exclusion list to cut out things we don't want
